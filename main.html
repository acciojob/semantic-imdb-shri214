			Indian Army Major Gana leaves the army and becomes a vigilante to punish crooked people who escaped justice due to faults in the legal system, He is raised by his paternal uncle Sripathi, who supports his cause but Gana's father Umapathi berates him for not having an aim in life.

One day, Gana is sent to a neighboring village to meet his prospective bride, Mahalakshmi Jaanu. She is the daughter of his father's friend, Jaya Prakash, who is an ex-IAS officer. However, Gana meets Hansitha Reddy, who is revealed to be the local MLA and falls for her. He tells an imaginary story to Umapathi that Jaanu rejected him, because he gets into fights. Vairam Dhanush is the son of Cheif Minister Reddy, who kills a farmer for refusing to hand over the land documents. Later, a rapist named Veerendra, seeks Dhanush's help as he actually raped and killed a girl. The girl's parents seek Hansitha's help where they file the petition in the court.

However due to Dhanush's influence, lack of evidence and the embarrassment faced in the court. The girl's parents commit suicide. Enraged, Gana thrashes Dhanush's lawyer and chops Veerandra's legs, which enrages Dhanush and decide to search for the unknown person (Gana). After learning his actions, Hansitha falls for Gana and promises to marry him if he swears in the presence of God that he will not indulge in violence, When Gana is about to do so, at the temple, A badly injured Jaanu arrives, running from Dhanush's henchmen who try to kill her. Gana strikes everyone, who tried to kill her and ultimately gives Jaanu courage. At Gana's house, Jaanu reveals that she didn't reject Gana.

Gana had arrived at Jaanu's village and had saved her from Obul Reddy, who is working for Dhanush. Then, Gana had declined the marriage. Jaanu explains how Dhanush tried to blackmail Jaya Prakash when he had been protecting farmers so that they would not have to sell their lands for laying down of oil pipelines. This incident infuriatated Dhanush, who kills the farmers, but Jaanu intervenes, where she slaps and insults Dhanush. Dhanush kills Jaya Prakash and tries to kill her, but she narrowly escaped and had ran for days to find Gana. Gana decides to solve her problems. He goes to Dhanush's home where he battles with his henchmen and tries to burn Dhanush alive, but Dhanush escapes.

Gana is questioned for the attack but claims that other people had thrashed Dhanush. Eventually, Obul Reddy reveals the truth about the atrocities that Dhanush committed in the village, and the media is thrown into an uproar. Dhanush arrives at DGP Ranjit's office to surrender. However, Dhanush shoots Ranjit and tries to kill Umapati, but Sripati takes the shot and left for dead. Reddy stops Dhanush from shooting anyone else and tells Umapati to call Gana and make him surrender to Dhanush. Gana arrives and is told that Sripati will be saved if he surrenders, Gana does so and is stabbed by Dhanush and his men. Reddy then tells Dhanush to kill Sripati, which enrages Gana into killing Reddy's bodyguards and Reddy.

Gana then fights Dhanush and decapitates him with an axe, when he tries to run over Sripathi and Umapathi. Later, Gana and Ranjit tells a cover story to the media that Reddy and Dhanush were killed while trying to protect Ranjit from unknown terrorists. Gana then announces Hansitha as a new candidate to become the new Chief Minister.

				The album received positive reviews from critics. 123Telugu in their review stated it as, Thaman has been criticized for scoring those routine numbers with his trade mark drum beats. But one should not forget that he always comes up with some chart topping songs all the time. Same is the case with Sarainodu too. Thaman sticks to the formula and gives what is the need of the hour, some foot tapping hit numbers. Blockbuster, You are my MLA, Telusa Telusa and Atiloka Sundari are our picks and will become huge hits. Finally, like always, Allu Arjun has a thumping music album where he can show off his crazy dance moves and impress everyone like the way this album does.[17] Behindwoods rated the album 2.75 out of 5 and stated it as "Sarrainodu is another fun filled album for Allu Arjun from S.S.Thaman. The album is quite stylish and impressively presented."[18] Times of India rated the album 3.5 out of 5, stating that "The album is peppered with hits and is sure to do well."[19] Indiaglitz rated the album 3.25 out of 5, with a verdict "Thaman's music keeps in mind the demands of a mega-talented dancer like Allu Arjun. Apart from that, the tunes are interesting. The singers are better than the lyrics."[20]
